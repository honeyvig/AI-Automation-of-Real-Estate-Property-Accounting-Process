# AI-Automation-of-Real-Estate-Property-Accounting-Process
We are a real estate management company looking to automate a repetitive accounting process currently managed manually in Excel on a Mac. The final accounting product for each property consists of three files in OneDrive:

1. A PDF file with annual bank statements
2. A PDF file with annual receipts
3. An Excel file containing the actual bookkeeping records

Each entry in the Excel sheet correlates to a bank transaction and typically has a corresponding receipt, though there are exceptions. We need an automation solution that can:

• Automate Excel entries and cross-check each entry in the Excel sheet against transactions in the bank statement PDF and link receipts as needed.
• Verify each Excel entry has the required documentation and flag any discrepancies.
• Use AI-based solutions (e.g., ChatGPT, Copilot, or custom-built AI tools) to handle or suggest categorization and reconciliation tasks.
• Operate efficiently on a Mac environment with seamless integration to OneDrive for file management.

Project Requirements:

• Expertise in AI and automation solutions (preferably with experience in accounting or financial data processing).
• Knowledge of document processing for PDFs and Excel automation.
• Ability to create an intuitive workflow, making it simple for a non-technical user to manage and monitor the process.
• Experience working with OneDrive integration and compatibility with MacOS.

Ideal Skills:

• Familiarity with tools like ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot, or custom AI models to handle repetitive tasks.
• Advanced proficiency in Excel and PDF document automation.
• Understanding of financial accounting or bookkeeping processes is a plus.

=============
To automate your real estate accounting process and streamline the workflow involving PDF bank statements, receipts, and Excel bookkeeping records, here's a breakdown of an approach that leverages Python for automation, AI for categorization, and integrates seamlessly with OneDrive for file management. Below is a solution outline:
Approach Outline

    File Retrieval and Integration with OneDrive:
        We will utilize the OneDrive API to access, download, and upload files from the OneDrive folder. This allows the system to automatically fetch the necessary files (PDF bank statements, receipts, and Excel files) and operate in real-time.

    Extracting Data from PDFs (Bank Statements and Receipts):
        PDF Parsing: We will use the PyMuPDF (also known as fitz) or pdfplumber library for parsing bank statement PDFs. These tools help in extracting tables and transaction data, such as transaction dates, amounts, and vendor information.
        OCR for Receipts: We will use Tesseract OCR for reading text from receipts (if receipts are in image format). If the receipts are already in PDF format, we can extract the relevant information using pdfplumber.

    Reading and Writing Data from Excel:
        Excel Data Extraction and Manipulation: We will use pandas to read and manipulate Excel sheets. We will cross-check each Excel entry against the bank transactions extracted from the PDF to match each transaction with receipts.
        AI-powered Categorization: We can use OpenAI GPT (ChatGPT or Copilot) to assist with categorizing transactions automatically, flagging discrepancies, and making suggestions for reconciliation based on predefined rules.

    Automated Workflow:
        Cross-checking Entries: For each entry in the Excel sheet, we’ll compare the bank transactions and link receipts where applicable. Discrepancies will be flagged for further review.
        AI-based Suggestions: The AI model will suggest categories for transactions (e.g., rent, maintenance) based on historical data patterns and its learned categorization model.
        Flagging Discrepancies: If any entries don't match the bank statement or lack receipts, they will be flagged for manual review.

    MacOS Integration:
        The solution will be designed to run seamlessly on MacOS, and all tools and libraries will be compatible with the macOS environment.
        The automation script will be scheduled using cron jobs or launchd to run at regular intervals.

Technical Steps
1. Integrating with OneDrive:

Using the OneDrive API with Python (via msal for authentication), we can automate the download and upload of files.

import msal
import requests

# Authentication with Microsoft Graph
def authenticate_onedrive(client_id, client_secret, tenant_id):
    authority = f"https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant_id}"
    app = msal.ConfidentialClientApplication(client_id, client_credential=client_secret, authority=authority)
    token = app.acquire_token_for_client(scopes=["https://graph.microsoft.com/.default"])
    return token['access_token']

# Example to fetch files from OneDrive
def download_file_from_onedrive(file_id, access_token):
    headers = {'Authorization': f'Bearer {access_token}'}
    url = f"https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/drive/items/{file_id}/content"
    response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
    return response.content  # The file content

2. Extracting Bank Transactions from PDFs:

import fitz  # PyMuPDF

def extract_bank_statement_data(pdf_path):
    doc = fitz.open(pdf_path)
    transaction_data = []

    for page in doc:
        text = page.get_text("text")
        # Assuming the transaction data is in tabular form, you can use regex to extract rows
        for line in text.split("\n"):
            # Extract relevant data (date, amount, vendor) from each line (adjust as needed)
            if 'transaction' in line:
                transaction_data.append(line)
    return transaction_data

3. Extracting Receipt Data using OCR:

import pytesseract
from PIL import Image

def extract_receipt_data(receipt_image_path):
    # Load image
    img = Image.open(receipt_image_path)
    # OCR to extract text
    receipt_text = pytesseract.image_to_string(img)
    return receipt_text

4. Excel Data Handling and AI Categorization:

import pandas as pd

def read_excel_data(excel_path):
    df = pd.read_excel(excel_path)
    return df

def categorize_transaction(transaction, model):
    # Use AI (e.g., ChatGPT) to suggest categories for a transaction
    # Example of using OpenAI's API for categorization
    import openai
    openai.api_key = "your-api-key"

    response = openai.Completion.create(
      model="text-davinci-003",
      prompt=f"Categorize this transaction: {transaction}",
      max_tokens=60
    )

    category = response.choices[0].text.strip()
    return category

def update_excel_with_categories(df, categories):
    df['Category'] = categories
    df.to_excel("updated_bookkeeping.xlsx", index=False)

5. Automating the Workflow:

import time

def automate_accounting_process():
    # Authenticate with OneDrive
    access_token = authenticate_onedrive(client_id="your-client-id", client_secret="your-client-secret", tenant_id="your-tenant-id")

    # Download files from OneDrive (Bank Statement, Receipts, Excel)
    bank_pdf = download_file_from_onedrive("bank_statement_file_id", access_token)
    receipts_pdf = download_file_from_onedrive("receipts_file_id", access_token)
    excel_file = download_file_from_onedrive("bookkeeping_file_id", access_token)

    # Process Bank Statements
    bank_transactions = extract_bank_statement_data(bank_pdf)

    # Process Receipts
    receipt_data = extract_receipt_data(receipts_pdf)

    # Process Excel Entries
    bookkeeping_df = read_excel_data(excel_file)

    # Categorize Entries
    categories = [categorize_transaction(transaction, "your-model") for transaction in bookkeeping_df['Transactions']]
    
    # Update Excel with categories
    update_excel_with_categories(bookkeeping_df, categories)

    # Save updated file back to OneDrive
    upload_file_to_onedrive("updated_bookkeeping.xlsx", access_token)

    print("Accounting process completed successfully!")

# Automate the process
automate_accounting_process()
